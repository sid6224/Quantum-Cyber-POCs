# Quantum vs Classical Password Bruteforcing

This repository contains a proof of concept implementation comparing quantum and classical approaches to password bruteforcing. The project demonstrates the potential impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity through a practical implementation using Qiskit.

## Overview

The project implements and compares:
- Classical brute force password search
- Quantum search using Grover's algorithm
- Performance analysis and visualization of both approaches

## Key Features

- Implementation of Grover's algorithm for quantum search
- Classical brute force implementation for comparison
- Performance benchmarking and visualization
- Analysis of algorithmic complexity
- Real hardware testing capabilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `src/Quantum_vs_Classical_Password_BruteForce.ipynb`
